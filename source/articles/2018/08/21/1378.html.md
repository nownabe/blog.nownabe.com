うすうす感じてたんですが翻訳は意味なさそうなのでやめました。気になったものへの感想だけ。

# COMPUTE

## Knative: GA

> Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform for building, deploying, and managing serverless workloads. It offers a set of middleware components for building source-centric and container-based applications that can run anywhere. 
> [Product page](https://cloud.google.com/knative/)

KnativeもうGAなんですね。GKEにアドオンとして入れるにはEarly Accessのリクエストが必要みたいです。

[Serverless add-on for Google Kubernetes Engine early access request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG5cCIiHhkW7srw9MWvdiLEsLXwJES1R3lnKgAn-opy3_iuQ/viewform)

# AI & MACHINE LEARNING

## AutoML Vision: beta

> AutoML Vision enables you to train machine learning models to classify your images according to your own defined labels. Train models from labeled images, evaluate their performance, then register them for serving through the AutoML API. 
> [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/)

まだベータだったんですね。

# DATA ANALYTICS

## BigQuery ML: beta
> BigQuery ML enables users without a deep knowledge of machine learning to rapidly create and execute ML models using standard SQL queries and without moving data. 
> [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigqueryml-intro)

これ面白いですよねー。こんな感じのクエリで機械学習モデルを学習できる機能です。評価や予測もできます。

```sql
CREATE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'
```

今は線形回帰と2値ロジスティック回帰だけみたいですが、いろいろできること増えそう。

# DEVELOPER TOOLS

> [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/tpus)

これだけで使えるようになるって書いてあるけど、それは便利だ。(試してない)

```
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    resources:
      limits:
        cloud-tpus.google.com/v2: 8
```
