# MANAGEMENT TOOLS

## Istio on Kubernetes Engine: beta

> Get one-click Istio deployment on Kubernetes Engine – or add Istio to an existing Kubernetes Engine cluster. Quickly create all the components you need to run an open-source service mesh to connect, manage, and secure microservices in a uniform way. [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/overview)

GKEにマネージドのIstioをデプロイできるようになったってやつです。いいですね！！ :tada:
既存のクラスタにも追加できて、AddonにIstioがあるのでそれをEnableにするだけです。

# COMPUTE

## Kubernetes Engine: flexible Pod CIDR

> Optimize IP utilization by controlling the use of Pod CIDR ranges across nodes by allowing users to specify the maximum number of Pods per node that they want to run. This feature allows for a more efficient allocation of Pod CIDR ranges from cluster-level CIDR for containers, and it helps reduce IP utilization. [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr)

各Nodeに割り当てるCIDRブロックを変更できる機能です。デフォルトでは`/24`を割り当て、Pod数は上限110ですがこれを`/28`まで減らせる感じです。

## App Engine standard environment – Python 3.7: GA

> Use the latest versions of popular libraries with Python 3 on Titanium. Features include the ability to access the file system and install third-party packages and dependencies that rely on native code – all with reduced cost and latency, and improved code portability. [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/)

filesystemやネイティブコードが動くのはgVisorの恩恵ですね。
